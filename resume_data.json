    "description": "I'm Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering, Information Systems at Northeastern University. I perceive the field of software engineering as enormously rewarding and have always been on the edge when it comes to exploring the power of programming and the wonders it can do. I established my own startup Webphoenix in 2017 and not very recently started working as a Django developer. Thereafter I became an expert in python and writing robust GraphQL APIs. The simplicity of programming using python boils down to two steps- Identify the essential and eliminate the rest. Having production-level experience with the Django framework and being expertise in python what excites me the most is swift automation using python. I am also a web enthusiast having hands-on experience in building various web applications. In addition, I am well versed with database technologies like SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and gained practical insights while developing the complex and vast backend for various projects. I have a great understanding of large-scale application deployment with Docker and AWS in production environments.",
